## Project Overview
This system allows users to:
- Search for flights between airports
- Book flights and manage bookings
- View booking history and user profiles
- Authenticate securely

The project is containerized using Docker and orchestrated with Docker Compose for easy local development and deployment.

## High-Level Architecture

```mermaid
graph TD;
  A[User] -->|Browser| B(Client: Next.js)
  B -->|REST API| C(Server: NestJS)
  C -->|Database| D[(PostgreSQL/Supabase)]
  C -->|Email/SSE| E[External Services]
```

- **Client (Next.js):** Handles all user interactions, UI rendering, and communicates with the backend via REST APIs.
- **Server (NestJS):** Manages business logic, authentication, flight and booking data, and interfaces with the database and external services.
- **Database:** Stores user, flight, and booking information (see server documentation for details).
